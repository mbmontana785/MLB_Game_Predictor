    "Bet MGM, FanDuel and DraftKings sportsbooks offer cashout options during games. For example, if your team is winning late in the game, you could cash out for a little bit less than the full amount you'd win if you waited until the end of the game. Conversely, you also could cash out a small amount to cut your losses if your team is losing. In-game probabilities would be helpful for cashout decisions, and also for sports trading.<br>"

    "## The opener problem\n",
    "Having data on the current pitcher during the game also would address a potential glitch in our current model when \"openers\" are used. An opener is a pitcher who pitches only the first or second inning. Sometimes this happens in \"bullpen\" games when a team doesn't have a true starting pitcher available and just pieces together innings with relievers. However, teams are starting to use openers before a legitimate starting pitcher. The opener might pitch an inning or two, and then the starter will go five or so innings. This way teams can have a more proven pitcher going later in the game. RotoGrinders often accounts for this, which is nice. RG often will indicate the pitcher expected to relieve the opener as the starter.<br>\n",

    "To implement an in-game model we'd have to comb the web for an affordable API that could give us real-time game data. The professional APIs can be really expensive. In the worst-case scenario, we could just follow the game we're betting on and input all the data ourselves. It might be a little labor intensive, but it could be manageable if inputting the name of the pitcher can fetch all the FG data, and then we just plug in inning, outs, score and occupied bases. "
